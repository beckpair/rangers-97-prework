        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hey guys! My name is Beck (they/them), and I'm 23. I'm based in Fort Smith, Arkansas, but have lived in Central Arkansas for the last five years. I live with my girlfriend, Gia, who is finishing up her marketing degree at the University of Central Arkansas, and our three <s>menaces to society</s> pets. We've got two cats, Wednesday (usually called Stinky) and Miss Ma'am (nickname turned actual name), and a seven-month-old pup named Athena. Athena is a service dog in training for Gia and we spend so much time training her to make her a Certified Good Dog.</p> 
        <p>Fun fact: She is <i>actually</i> a certified STAR Puppy!</p>

            <h4>Why Do I Wanna Be a Software Engineer?</h4>
              <p>My dad has worked with computers my whole life, so it's something I've always been exposed to but never really done anything with. Since graduating, I've really struggled to find what I want to do as a career. I found through my work at escape rooms that I really, really enjoy solving puzzles. I also had the opportunity to program the light board for a production I was in a few years ago. Seeing the lights move and change colors simply because I typed in some numbers and pressed some buttons really gave me a dopamine burst. I mentioned this to my dad and he actually suggested programming to me, and now I'm here.</p>
              <p>I would be remiss if I didn't attribute any interest in coding to my early Tumblr days as a 12 year old. I would spend hours messing around with the HTML code to make my blog look <i>exactly</i> the way I wanted, so, y'know.</p>
              <p>Another aspect of this field I'm so drawn to is the ability to do this from anywhere and work remotely! I love to travel and want to do a lot of it in my life, so I feel like this kind of career would make that so accessible.</p>
